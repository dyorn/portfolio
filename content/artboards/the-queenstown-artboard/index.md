# {spontaneity}

a trip that started of as an idea fueled by the drinks of a melbourne pub with a friend I had only met twice prior. that friend was nick, and we spent five days in queenstown, new zealand. 

it's hard to describe the beauty of new zealand in a way that serves it any justice, so i'll just let the pictures speak for themselves on that front. we went skydiving and saw the snow covered alps, took a gondola up a mountain, zip lined and luged through the forests on said mountain, and had possibly the best burgers to date. 

plus a wine tour for good measure. 

and a singing dog just next to the lake.

all of this from going along with a drunken idea at a pub. cheers, nick.
