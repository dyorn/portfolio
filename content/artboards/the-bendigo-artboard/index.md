# {light_streaks}

not a whole lot to say about this one. we spent the weekend in bendigo to celebrate joe's sister's birthday, and aussies really know how to throw a good party. it almost felt like we were intruding - the brother's friends from uni coming to celebrate his sister's birthday with a lot of family - yet it didn't. we were welcomed as if we were a part of the family.
