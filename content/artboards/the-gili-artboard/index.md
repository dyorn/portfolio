we spent twenty four hours on gili trawangan, an island so small that you can walk across it in thirty minutes. the only forms of transportation were bikes and horses, and we chose bikes. unfortunately, the horses wore blinders and had visible scarring, and some quick research reveals that most of the horses are treated poorly. :(

the island itself was beautiful. parts of it were clearly under repair from prior storm damage, but that didn't detract from the beaches and blue water. 

and don't even get me started on the sunset. top ten easily. my favorite observation: you'd have to go out of your way to avoid being offered some mushrooms to purchase.

yes, those kinds of mushrooms. 

anyways, gili was beautiful. and now I can tell people that I biked around an entire island. :)
