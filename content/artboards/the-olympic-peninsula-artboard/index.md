unfortunately, like my rooftop artboard I'm also writing this from the future. fortunately, I can still remember the trip like it was yesterday. hoh rainforest was one of my favorite hikes ever, complete with a huge river, clearings of sunshine, photogenic trees and mountains in the horizon. in all I think we hiked about 7 miles, a good half day break between the driving.
