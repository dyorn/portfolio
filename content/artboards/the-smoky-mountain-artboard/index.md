# {serene}

serene is both the most and least accurate word to describe the trip. on the one hand, the cabin and mountains were about as isolated and calm as we could be - it was truly peaceful. but on the other hand, tensions and fears were extremely high over the growing spread of coronavirus. writing this just two months later, it feels like it took place a year ago.

we started the hike in a deep fog, and as we got higher up and further along the trail the fog cleared into a bright sunny day, before returning again during the descent. I finally realized the meaning behind the name.
