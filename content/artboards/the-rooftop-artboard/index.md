# {nostalgia}

unlike my other artboards, I'm writing this almost two years after the shoot. I've been bad about keeping my website up to date and properly sharing all my photographs. so here I am as I wax nostalgic about my senior year of college and college as a whole. four years blown by just like a heavy gust on that roof. memories sealed - "what-ifs" graduated to "remember-whens"
