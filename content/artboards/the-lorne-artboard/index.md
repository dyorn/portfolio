# {reminiscence}

after exams, we spent six days at an airbnb in lorne, just two blocks from the ocean with a beautiful view from the balcony. every morning we were greeted by loud cockatoos, with one even joining us on the balcony. 

the trip itself was lowkey, hanging around the beach or watching movies and playing pool on the days it rained, but that was much needed after queenstown. my flight back to the states was just a day later, which is why reminiscence is the name of this art board. we did a lot of that in those six days.
