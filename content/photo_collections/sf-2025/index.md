# {sf, 2025}
went to sf and santa cruz to visit some friends for a long weekend. sf was wonderful with perfect weather the entire time. we did make the mistake of trying to ride some dead electric divvy bikes up a steep hill. we had to walk them up halfway. golden gate park was vaster than anticipated.
