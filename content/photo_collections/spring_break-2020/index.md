# {gatlinburg}
the week before quarantine. we had a cabin in the middle of the smoky mountains near gatlinburg, featuring a hot tub and a two player arcade table. it felt surreal - tensions were extremely high but no stay-at-home orders had been made yet, and at one point a mass text fearing marshall law took off (likely of russian or chinese origin). 

this was my first real road trip. champaign, il -> quick stop in nashville, tn -> three nights in gatlinburg -> two nights in gulf shores.
